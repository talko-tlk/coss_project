## General Introduction

Recent industry examples highlight the challenges that companies face in recovering from a disruption. For instance, Toyota had a supply network disruption in the aftermath of the 2011 tsunami in Japan. This poses challenges to the companies’ reaction towards the crisis. Resilience, an indicator of the capacity to undergo deep change without or prior to a crisis, has been widely used as a parameter to examine the ability to stabilize within a system. The scientists have taken various perspectives on examining disruptions and resilience. So far, scholars recognize the importance of understanding supply network disruptions and resilience for market forecast. However, few studies have been extended to the interaction between disruption and resilience among companies that are interrelated. 

## 

## The Model

We want to measure the performances of network structures facing the cascading disruption under pure self-recovery or the external incentive. Also we would like to discuss how the network loss facing the disruption varies with the parameters of the model, including the response time, the recovery rate and the stimulation amplitude of the incentive.

## 

## Fundamental Questions

1. How will the network performance change with the external incentive?
2. How will the parameter change cause the varying performance of the network resilience?

## 

## Expected Results

1.The stimulation measure efficiently improved networks’ self-recovery ability as well as the resilience to disturbances for all the three networks discussed.

2-1.  The higher recovery rate, the less capital loss;

2-2.  Implementing the stimulation as early as possible is favorable to reduce the capital loss. Starting the stimulation before spreading of disturbances could be a very efficient choice. The delayed stimulation measure may have very limited effect because the disturbance already spread through the network. 

2-3.  Adjustment of amplitude of resources input affect the capital loss. The capital loss decreases with increasing amplitude in a non-linear way. This curve can help determine a best strategy considering both the cost of resources input and the capital loss prevention.

## Light test

1. Before doing the test: Our network is randomly generated each time, so the specific result won't be the same. But you could find the similarities between results.
2. Download all the files in **CODE**
3. Open the MainFunction_For_Test.m 
4. Follow the instructions there and run one section by section( It is strongly recommended to run in section to show all the files)
5. It won't take long, maybe 3-10 minutes.
